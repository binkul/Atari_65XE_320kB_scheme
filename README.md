# Atari_65XE_320kB_scheme

It is working, but there is problem with video. The image on the monitor is not clear. There is a lot of white vertical stripes - probably wrong GND project. 
There can be used up to four diffrent OS and eight internal languages, like MAC65, Action!, Basic XE, XL. On Board GTIA fixer and 256kB extra RAM.
